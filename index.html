            I am 31 years old and i have just started my coding carrer and it is going really good.
            Before this I was a commerical diver traveling the united states doing different kinds of 
            jobs all on, in, and around the water. I have demolished old lock and damns, Salvaged new 
            and old fishing vessels alike, and countless other jobs. I was a diver for almost 8 years
            and now I am looking for a new challenge.

    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated <i>Corning Union High School</i> in 2011 after which i attended 
            <i>Butte Community College</i> for 2 years not really knowing what i wanted
            to do with my life yet
        </p>
        <p> 
            After a few years of working I went to Seattle, WA to the <i>Divers Institute 
            of Technology</i> where I learned the basics of what it took to be a commerical
            diver and obtained my certification to work as a Commercial Diver.

                    learning experience since I had no prior teaching experience, but since I
                    was a skilled snowboarder to begin with I was ready for the challenge and
                    getting to have fun playing in the snow was a great bonus.

                <p> Potable Water Diving is cleaning and inspecting drinking water for 
                    town districts so they dont have to drain all the water out and waste millions of 
                    dollars. Instead we go in (Disinfected of course) and we clean and inspect
                    the whole tank while it is full that way it gets clean and the customer
                    doesnt have to drain the water out.
