  I have spent the last 8 years working as a Commercial Diver, which most people automatically think
  that all i ever do is weld underwater because they saw a few youtube videos of people doing it and to be honest that 
  is what drove me to become a commercial diver in the first place as well, but in fact i have probably only welded 
  twice in my 8 years in the field. Instead what i did the most of is Salvage, Burning, and Inspections. Over the years 
  I have traveled to and worked in 19 different states (some of those states were just some Potable Water
  Tank cleaning and inspecting jobs that usualy only took a few days so I dont know if I would count some of them) and
  done some pretty amazing things.

  I have spent two months in panama city beach flordia following hurricane Micheal
  salvaging a semi-complete fishing vessel that was suppose to set sail the following year. 
</p>
<p>
  I spent almost a year and a half salvaging and scraping around 10 derelict vessels in a section of the 
  Columbia River in Washington State that had been polluting the river for years

  My spring and summer of 2019 was spent in a small town about 10 miles from supermans own towm(Metropolis, IL) called
  Olmsted IL where I helped deconstruct an old lock and dam and also help with the construction of the new lock and dam
  that was ment to replace the old one. I will say that spending around 3 hours a day(or night in my case since I was on
  the night shift) underwater with a torch that can melt steel was pretty awesome and I was getting paid well which was
  a major plus.

  The last year and a half of my diving carrer I spent traveling to every state west of the Mississippi River and I would climb, 
  clean, and then inspect Potable water tanks(Mainly the drinking water for the cities that we traveled to). Some of the tanks
  would be 200' towers that you see driving on the freeway usualy with the town name on it and those tanks we a pain to climb up.
